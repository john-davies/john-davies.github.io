# Trig Point Navigator

Website link - https://john-davies.github.io/

This is a web app that combines my interests in hill-walking, photography, 3D modelling and general mapping. The origin and some background to the app can be found in my blog posts:

* https://theretiredengineer.wordpress.com/2018/08/26/trig-point-camera-mount/
* https://theretiredengineer.wordpress.com/2019/07/14/pannellum-and-map-integration/
* https://theretiredengineer.wordpress.com/2018/11/25/trig-point-photo-update/

This stand alone app is a way of pulling these all together and to provide a framework to which I can easily add more panoramas. My plan is to add a pano from each of the trig points on the map and to link them together.

The trig points that I've chosen are a small subset of thise available but they're the ones that I pass fairly regularly on my walks around the western end of the [Brecon Beacons](http://www.breconbeacons.org/) and [Gower Peninsula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gower_Peninsula) in Wales.

## Additional Software

The web app makes use of some additional software:

### Panorama Viewer
* [Pannellum](https://pannellum.org/) - a
  lightweight, free, and open source panorama viewer for the web.
  Built using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and WebGL, it is plug-in free.

### Map Viewer

* [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) - an open-source JavaScript library for mobile-friendly
  interactive maps.

* Additional [colour markers](https://github.com/pointhi/leaflet-color-markers) for Leaflet, also some added by me.

### Other Media

* Extra icons from [Android Asset Studio](https://romannurik.github.io/AndroidAssetStudio/index.html)
